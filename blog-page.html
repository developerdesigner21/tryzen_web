                        And as you can see from the tips we gave in this post: restaurant SEO is not complicated. You
                        don’t need a developer to dive into the details of technical SEO. You don’t need to hire a
                        digital marketing agency.
                        We’ve automated a lot of these things at Owner.com. If you want to see how we do it, book a demo
                        here. But you don’t need to use our platform to take action on any of the tips we covered today.
                        The most important thing with SEO is that you start ASAP. It can take time to kick in, and you
                        don’t want your competitors to read this post before you do.
